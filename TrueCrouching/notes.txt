These files are not changed but they were included in the mod to prevent errors and pretty much make it work.
I compared files but there could be more like them.
Or maybe these were also edited, I don't know anything anymore :)

turn.xml
turn_idle_sneak.xml
turn_aim.xml
turn_aim_90.xml
turn_aim_180.xml
