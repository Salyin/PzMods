   - Track if the functions are being properly executed (For example, if Anorexy is present, there are logs for the Anorexy functions).
   - Track of the ModData values changes (For example, if Smoker is present and the player doesn't smoke, that the ModData increases as expected).

C) New Traits: Nervous Wreck and Melancholic. Files affected: DTByOtherConditions, DTMainCreationMethods, DTmodifiers.lua, DTMainFile.lua
   - Both are Dynamic Traits BUT will only affect who choosed them at the start (if you didn't pick them in the character creation then you won't ever have to deal with them).
   - Nervous Wreck can be treated with Betablockers, Melancholic can be treated with Antidepressants (one per day is enough to keep them always removed).
   - DTPillsBeta(Nervous Wreck) and DTPillsAntiDep(Melancholic) are the internal values for the traits. While the value is under or equals to 24 the traits are not present. Above 24 the traits are added. (It increases one per hour and decreases in 24 each time a pill is taken).
   - Having the traits will increase in 30% all the Stress and Unhappyness gains from others traits. Example: the Unhappyness and Stress generated by Alcoholic will be 30% higher if the traits are present.
   - Passively if the traits are present, each hour the unhappyness and stress will increase.
   - If no pills are taken the value will keep increasing up to 240 (10 days) so to remove the traits, 10 pills would be required.

E) Due to the Pills overdose, the fatigue reduction by taking vitamins was increased from 2 to 7 (to make them worth it).

   - Instead of looking for specific Strength and Fitness Levels it will check for the Strength and Fitness Traits to add/remove traits.
   - "ThickSkinned" is obtained if "Strong" is present. Is removed when "Underweight". "ThinSkinned" is obtained if "Very Underweight".

   - DTPlantsKnowledge will increase between 0 and 5 per each plant studied.
   - Reach to a value greater than 100 in DTPlantsKnowledge and Herbalist will be given.

F) Traits by moving objects: File affected: DTByOtherConditions.lua, new file: DTByMovingObjects.lua
   - Slighly changed how it works. Instead of the code being executed in the update function(that runs per tick) it will now be executed in the perform function(that runs once the item is moved). This will allow two things: the first one is that everyone will increase the same amount when moving objects (as the update runs every tick and the tick is attached to FPS, higher FPS meant getting the trait faster), the second one is that as now the code will be executed when the item is fully moved, it won't care the game speed, it will always increase in the same amount.
   - The amount will now increased based on a base value that will be multiplied by the item weight, so heavier objects will increase more.
   - Everything else works as always.
G) Code improvements for Pills related traits (doesn't change how it works). File affected: DTByOtherConditions.lua, new file: DTPillsTraits.lua
H) Code improvements for Fitness related traits (doesn't change how it works). File affected: DTexpandedActionsEffects.lua

   - Pluviophile and Pluviophobia will now increase/decrease the Anger.
   - Being angry will now increase the stress and unhappyness.

   - Books will spawn in the same places as the others.

On Steam, Update 10 Oct 2022:

   - The XP Multiplier continues as always being given only when the regularity is maxed (value 100).
   - The XP Multiplier will now be removed when reaching regularity under 99.7 (it takes about 50 in-game hours). This will allow to be a little more free when doing the exercises and not be tied to do it at the exact same hour every day.
B) Pass Out: File affected:
   - Being much time with the Tired Moodle in Lv4 can will make the player to pass out.
   - While being panicked the player won't pass out and also the time to pass out will increase.
   - While walking, running or sprinting the player won't pass out.
   - The player can pass out while driving. (The vehicle won't stop, so be carefully to not force stop it against a wall).

D) Pills Allergy trait:
   - Trait cost is 6.
   - Taking pills (Vitamins, Betablockers, Antidepressants, Sleeping Tablets, Painkillers) will generate 40 in Allergy (affected in +- 30% by ProneToIllness or Resilient).
   - Taking antibiotics will generate a different amount that can be higher or lower but will tend to reach the Lv4 of the Allergy Moodle.
E) Wild Plants Allergy trait:
   - Trait cost is 2.
   - Allergy to Mushrooms and Berries.
   - Each Mushroom will generate 40 in Allergy Moodle. Each Berry will generate 30 in Allergy Moodle.
   - The only way to eat Mushrooms and/or Berries is to overcook them. For example: cooking a pot of stew with Mushrooms and eating that will still generate Allergy. BUT, if from that Pot, Bowls of Stew are served, then the Allergy will no longer occur. (Not intended but nothing I can do here due to how the game manages the bowls :( ). Basically the Mushroom or the Berry needs to disssapear from the food as an ingredient.
F) Physically Active:
   - Is now mutually exclusive with Obese, Overweight, Weak, Feeble, Unfit, Out of Shape and Very Underweight.
   - Fixed a bug where the trait would disappear when selecting Fitness Instructor as profession.
G) Time to play the Bloodlust sounds when no zombie is killed was increased from 24 to 48 hours when no books read and from 72 to 120 hours when the books are read.
H) Melancholic and Nervous Wreck trait:
   - The traits will now appear after 48 hours if no medicine are consumed (it was 24 before).
   - Both traits can now be developed during the game (before this update they only appeared if the player picked them in the character creation).
   - After the first month (720 hours) the mod will check: if the player already had them or they can be developed.
   - Every hour the mod will do a roll if: the Stress/Unhappiness Moodles are different than 0 AND if the traits were not developed yet. If so, it will do a roll in a range of: hoursSurvived / Moodle Level. This means that while more Stress or Unhappiness we have, more chances of developing the traits we have, but while the more we survive, the greater the range is, and as a consequence, the harder it will be to develop them.
   - The rolls are independant, so the player can develop one and not the other (or maybe do not develop them at all).
   - Once developed, the traits will continue to work as always.
I) Fixed a bug where starting with Desensitized would not give Bloodlust ever.

On Steam, Hotfix 13 Oct 2022:
A) Updated Russian Translation.

- Added a minor check for Pass Out mechanic that won't trigger the Pass Out if the player is Aiming (to avoid Pass Out while fighting without moving).

On Steam, Hotfix 1 Nov 2022:

B) Pass Out:
- Since 41.78 the Pass Out mechanic stopped working as the code to force the player to sleep is doing nothing, fixed this by using different code. 
- Added a minor check for Pass Out mechanic that won't trigger the Pass Out if the player is Aiming (to avoid Pass Out while fighting without moving).

On Steam, Update 25 Nov 2022:
A) Fix for Cook trait translation.
B) Herbalist trait: 
- Added BerryPoisonIvy to study defs, now all berries can be studied to get Herbalist.
- Slighly increased the threshold to obtain Herbalist.
- After finishing the study action the berry/mushroom will be unequipped. (If multiple berries/mushrooms are studied at the same time, the "unequip" action is queued multiple times too, just cancel it after the first time or wait for it).
- The player can now walk while studying. 
C) Chef profession: Nutritionist trait added as a free trait.
D) Entirely redone the trait by levels system, now each trait will require different levels based on the profession picked making all professions easier to obtain certain traits but harder to obtain others.
E) Entirely reworked the fracture by heavy load system. It will now take into consideration new factors: Flimsy/Frail, Anorexia, Weak/Feeble/Stout/Strong, Lucky/Unlucky, Strongback/Metalstrongback from Snake's modpack, if the player is walking, running or sprinting.
F) Fix for recipe name "Make Wooden Box Trap".
G) Added Rosehips to the Wild Plants Allergy trait.
H) Heavily decreased the required threshold required to remove All Thumbs and Disorganized (it was very tedious to remove both of them). The positive ones remains the same.
I) Anorexia trait:
- Renamed it to Anorexia from Anorexy.
- Code improvement (Logic remains the same).
- Icon updated.
J) Angler trait and Fisherman profession now reduces negative Moodles while fishing.
K) Gum when consumed will remove the stressFromCigarettes without affecting the progress to remove Smoker trait.
L) Bloodlust trait:
- Base range to be obtained changed from 12000 to 15000.
- The system will now only consider the kills to decide if add the trait instead of kills + time survived as the other traits in the system.

On Steam, Update 17 Dec 2022:
A) Buffed a little bit the benefits to remove Smoker, Alcoholic and Anorexia by doing exercise.
B) Buffed/Nerfed Lucky/Unlucky modifier for Agora/Claustro traits. (If you have Lucky, it will be a buff, if you have Unlucky, it will be a debuff).
C) Physically active trait:
- Running and Sprinting will now help to obtain the trait (Chopping trees, Fighting and doing exercise are still valid ways to obtain it).
- Walking, Running and Sprinting will now apply the positive effects. (Walking being the one with the lower effect).
D) Sedentary trait:
- Running and sprinting now generates pain in the legs.
E) Prodigy Trait:
- Running and Sprinting will grant extra XP if the trait is present.
F) Overdose:
- Energy drinks overdose reduced from 35 to 30.
- Maximum energy drinks overdose reduced from 70 to 65 (Now even with Weak Stomach, the player won't fall under the latest level of the Moodle which can kill the player).

On Steam, Update 06 Feb 2023:
A) Added a Bloodlust Moodle.

On Steam, Update 13 Feb 2023:
A) Passing Out mechanic:
- Slightly increased the threshold before passing out.
- Slightly decreased the rate the threshold increases every minute.
- After the threshold is reached, the player needs to stay quiet for 7 in-game minutes (about 15 seconds real life) before passing out. (Quiet means no walking, running, sprinting or aiming). This gives enough time to put a bonfire for example. Doing one of those actions is considered as being "Active" which resets the quiet counter.
- Added a new condition to when the threshold doesn't increase: having Lv3 or Lv4 of Hypothermia Moodle.
B) Cats eyes trait:
- Now it will be based on the square light levels instead of specific night hours, this means that even during the day the trait can be earned if in dark places.
- The trait can now be also removed (in the past once obtained, it was permanent).
- If light level is under 0.5 the trait makes progress to be obtained. If above 0.5 the trait decreases progress and can be even removed. If the player already has Cats Eyes when above 0.5 an extra removal progress is added.
- Security Guard, Burglar, Fire Officer and Police Officer keeps having buffs to obtain the trait as they had before.
C) Outdoorsman traits:
- Points changed from 6 to 8.
- The trait can now be also removed (in the past once obtained, it was permanent).
- The way to obtain it remains the same. To remove it the player needs to stay inside. If the trait is present and the player is inside or in a vehicle while weather conditions, it is removed faster (as the player would like to be outside). Having Pluviophile while inside and raining, removes it faster. Having Hiker while inside and snowing, removes it faster.
- If the trait is present and the player is outside and not in a vehicle while raining or snowing, the Stress, Unhappiness and Anger decreases (fog and wind not considered as most of the time there's one of them).
D) Flimsy and Frail Strength reduction:
- The mechanic before entirely removed one level and all its XP. Now the mod will store the current XP, remove the lvl and add back the XP stored. In low level this may generate that the stored XP was enough to level up so the player would end up having the same level BUT with less XP. So it is much less impactful in low levels now compared to high levels where the XP difference between levels is enough to not be able to gain it back.
E) Rain Traits:
- Code clean up.

Not on Steam yet:
A) Poison function (used across several traits and moodles)
- Will now also consider Slow Healer and Fast Healer to increase/decrease the poison.
B) Allergies:
- Current allergy renamed to Food Allergy, and created a new one for Drugs Allergy (pills) that now has the Pills Allergy trait assigned to it.
- Food/Drugs Allergy will now increase more/less if Iron Gut/Weak Stomach and/or Resilient/Prone To Illness are present.
- Food/Drugs Allergy will now decrease faster/slower if Iron Gut/Weak Stomach and/or Fast Healer/Slow Healer are present.
- Food Allergy Moodle Lv4 will now also increase sickness.
- Berries now generates 15 instead of 30, Rosehips generates 20, Mushrooms generates 30 instead of 40.
- Wild Plants Allergy trait cost changed from -2 to -4.
- Added new food to the Wild Plants Allergy trait: Violets, 5 Allergy; Sunflower Seeds, 5 Allergy; Grape Leaves, 5 Allergy; Acorn, 20 Allergy; Dandelions, 5 Allergy; Nettles, 5 Allergy; Thistle, 5 Allergy.
- Drugs allergy effects: Moodle Lv1: Cough (more frequent than Food Allergy sneezes); Moodle Lv2: Cough plus Itching in certain body parts (more frequent than Food Allergy); Moodle Lv3: Itching in almost the entire body, endurance decrease and poison increase; Moodle Lv4: Moodle Lv3 effects plus itching in the missing parts, fatigue decrease, endurance decrease and health decrease.
- Pills now increases 30 drug allergy instead of 40 (now with two pills taken together the player reaches the top of Lv2 Moodle which makes it a little bit safer as deadly effects starts at Lv3). Except for Vitamins that increases only 15.
C) Fractures:
- Fractures can now only happen at Lv4 of the Overloaded Moodle.
- Removed one division the code was making that heavily increased the fracture chances based on the Moodle LvL (3 or 4), as now it only occurs at Lv4, the division no longer makes sense. So basically, the fractures are even much less often now.
D) Colds:
- Now the cold by wetness can only be triggered at Lv3 and Lv4 of Wetness only (removed Lv2)
E)
- If FWOFitnessWorkoutOverhaul module of Fitness & Workout Overhaul mod is activated, my XP multiplier code by fitness regularity won't be executed, instead that mod will take over that functionality.
- Prodigy, Sedentary and Physically Active traits will now apply their effects to the new exercises added by FWOBenchPress&Treadmill module.
F) Outdoorsman trait:
- Minor bug fix from latest update.
G) Overdoose:
- Vitamins now generate 8 overdose instead of 12 (all others pills remains in 12)
H) Prodigy trait:
- Drastically reduced the extra XP obtained by Prodigy when doing exercise. (Other bonuses as Chopping trees, fighting etc remains the same).
J) Physically Active:
- Cost changed from 5 to 6.

A) Body condition:
- Light Eater and Hearty Appitite are now tied to Strength traits at normal weight. If Weak or Feeble are present, Light Eater will be present, if Stout or Strong are present, Hearty Appitite will be present.
- Low Thirst and High Thirst are now tied to Fitness traits at normal weight. If Unfit or Out of Shape are present, Low Thirst will be present, if Fit or Athletic are present, High Thirst will be present.
- If Underweight or Very Underweight and also Stout or Strong are present at the same time, no trait is added.
- If Overweight or Obese, both Hearty Appitite and High thirst will be present.
- Added Prone to Illness and Slow Healer to Overweight and Obese with the same behavior than it already was for Underweigth and Very Underweight.
- Added 2 new traits: Flabby and Brittle Knees which will works exactly the same as Flimsy and Frail but for Fitness when getting Overweight or Obese.
B) Obese and Very Underweight:
- Due to the changes related to Body Condition both traits changed from -10 to -16.
C) Wakeful:
- The trait is no longer part of the body condition system, it will now depend on mood only and will be present if Stress, Unhappiness, Boredom and Hungry Moodles are 0.
D) Bloodlust:
- Removed sounds.
- After 24 hours (48 hours with the books read) the effects starts as always, after 48 hours (72 hours with the books read) the negative effects are higher.
- The Moodle now has 4 levels, the Lv4 of the Moodle will now trigger the function for Pills Traits Development which means that if Bloodlust is not controlled, Melancholic and Nervous Wreck can be obtained.
E) Pills Traits:
- Melancholic and Nervous Wreck can now be developed after first week instead of first month
F) Removed rain mechanic that made the player to actually get wet as that is going to be part of a new mod. DT will keep its scope within Traits, Moods and professions.

A) Alcoholic trait: Entirely reworked the trait
- The trait now works based on EveryOneMinute instead of EveryOneHour which means is going to be checking more often which was the big failure in the old code.
- If the Drunk Moodle is not present, progress to remove the trait occurs.
- If the Drunk Moodle is present, progress to obtain the trait occurs based on the Moodle Level so at higher levels the faster it increases towards the trait.
- The effects are now progressive, in the first 24 hours after the Drunk Moodle was present the Stress, Unhappiness and Anger increases, after 48 hours the Headache and Tiredness increases, after 72 hours the sickness increases. All based on rolls so is not a guarantee it will increase.
- Drinking alcohol will now reduce progress based on: Hunger reduction, Thirst reduction and Alcohol Power of the drink (basically its stats) plus the Moodle presence as stated before.
- Drinking something (vanilla or Snake's modpack drinks, if any other mod wants to be compatible, its alcoholic drinks needs to add the "OnEat = OnEat_Alcohol" to its items) sets the counter for effects to 0 which means that the effects will stop for a period of time. Progress will be lost but maybe is required under life/death situations.
- Lucky/Unlucky keeps working the same as they can help or not with the progress.
- Doing exercise keeps helping to remove the trait.
- The threshold changed. In the old code you needed to reach up to 30 days counted in hours without drinking to remove the trait. Now is a little bit different. You you need to reach a value of 44640 to remove the trait or -44640 to obtain it. Remember that now the code now runs based on minutes instead of hours, so 44640 means 31 days.
- When creating the player, the value that decides if the trait is added or removed starts as 0 if the Alcoholic trait is not picked and as -44640 if the Alcoholic trait is picked. So if you start with the trait your progress to remove it will be from -44640 to 44640 (62 days if exercise is not done and Lucky is not present).
- The counter can stack up to -50000 or 50000.
B) Wild plants allergy:
- Allergy is now equals to the Hunger reduction of the plant instead of a static value.
C) Overdose:
- Energy drinks, Maximum Energy drinks, Tragos and Alcoholic drinks now generates overdose equals to hunger reduction + thirst reduction. (This "fixes" a little bit the problem of drinking 1/2 and 1/4 and still receiving the same overdose, now the first half/quarter will be the entire hunger + thirst reduction (can't control that) but after that as the hunger + thirst will be lower, the overdose will also be lower)
D) New trait: Addicted to caffeine (Only available if LeGourmet mod is also enabled)
- Hot Drinks with Coffee or Tea (or Coffee or Tea without the drink), CoffeBeans, Energy Drinks, Maximum Energy Drinks, Mate, Cola Drink and Soda Cola Drink affects the caffeine level on the body.
- Caffeine level that each item increases is equals to Fatigue reduction * 15.
- The caffeine level decreases 1 each in-game minute.
- While caffeine level is higher than 0, progress to obtain the trait is made in 1 per in-game minute.
- At the moment the caffeine is consumed, the progress increases once in the amount of fatigue reduction * 10
- While caffeine level is 0 and at least 24 hours passed before the last caffeine consumption, progress to remove the trait is made in 1 per in-game minute.
- Having the trait and caffeine level higher than 0 gives a positive Moodle that will decrease stress, anger and fatigue.
- Having the trait and caffeine level is 0 plus more than 24 hours passed since last caffeine will give a negative Moodle that will increase stress, anger and generate headache.
- Having the trait and being between 24 hours and 120 hours without caffeine, during the day (from 6 to 20) will increase the fatigue.
- Having the trait and being between 24 hours and 120 hours without caffeine, during the night (before 6 and after 20) will decrease the fatigue (insomne).
- Reach a value of 10080 to remove the trait. Reach a value of -10080 to obtain the trait (basically the corresponding value in minutes for 7 days)
- If the trait is not picked, the progress value starts in 0, if the trait is picked, the progress starts in -10080
- The progress value can stack up to 14400 or -14400 (10 days)
